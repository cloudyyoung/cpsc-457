# dirStats - skeleton for Assignment 2

To compile all code, type:
```
$ make
```

To run the resulting code on directory test1:
```
$ ./dirstats test1
```
## IMPORTANT

Only modify and submit the `getDirStats.cpp` file. Your TAs will
supply their own versions of the other files (such as main.cpp) to
compile and test your code.
